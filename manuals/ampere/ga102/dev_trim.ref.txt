NV_PVTRIM_SYS_LINK_REFCLK_CFG(i)
These registers controls the reference clock connected to each DP link.
    0-5 correspond to LINKA-LINKF respectively.
    FREQ: selects the reference clock frequency.
    SRC:  selects the source of reference clock.
    POWERDOWN: controls the powerdown feature of all the analog muxes and buffers associated with the DP link.

                         KEY LEGEND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each define in the .ref file has a 5 field code to say what kind of define it is: i.e. /* RW--R */
The following legend shows accepted values for each of the 5 fields:
  Read, Write, Internal State, Declaration/Size, and Define Indicator.

  Read
    ' ' = Other Information
    '-' = Field is part of a write-only register
    'C' = Value read is always the same, constant value line follows (C)
    'R' = Value is read


  Write
    ' ' = Other Information
    '-' = Must not be written (D), value ignored when written (R,A,F)
    'W' = Can be written


  Internal State
    ' ' = Other Information
    '-' = No internal state
    'X' = Internal state, initial value is unknown
    'I' = Internal state, initial value is known and follows (I), see "Reset Signal" section for signal.
    'E' = Internal state, initial value is known and follows (E), see "Reset Signal" section for signal.
    'B' = Internal state, initial value is known and follows (B), see "Reset Signal" section for signal.
    'C' = Internal state, initial value is known and follows (C), see "Reset Signal" section for signal.

    'V' = (legacy) Internal state, initialize at volatile reset
    'D' = (legacy) Internal state, default initial value at object creation (legacy: Only used in dev_ram.ref)
    'C' = (legacy) Internal state, initial value at object creation
    'C' = (legacy) Internal state, class-based initial value at object creation (legacy: Only used in dev_ram.ref)


  Declaration/Size
    ' ' = Other Information
    '-' = Does Not Apply
    'V' = Type is void
    'U' = Type is unsigned integer
    'S' = Type is signed integer
    'F' = Type is IEEE floating point
    '1' = Byte size (008)
    '2' = Short size (016)
    '3' = Three byte size (024)
    '4' = Word size (032)
    '8' = Double size (064)


  Define Indicator
    ' ' = Other Information
    'C' = Clear value
    'D' = Device
    'L' = Logical device.
    'M' = Memory
    'R' = Register
    'A' = Array of Registers
    'F' = Field
    'V' = Value
    'T' = Task
    'P' = Phantom Register

    'B' = (legacy) Bundle address
    'G' = (legacy) General purpose configuration register
    'C' = (legacy) Class

  Reset signal defaults for graphics engine registers.
    All graphics engine registers use the following defaults for reset signals:
     'E' = initialized with engine_reset_
     'I' = initialized with context_reset_
     'B' = initialized with reset_IB_dly_

  Reset signal
    For units that differ from the graphics engine defaults, the reset signals should be defined here:
